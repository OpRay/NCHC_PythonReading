# Mix 'n' Match
# Great work! We're almost done with boolean operators.
#
# # Make me false
# bool_one = (2 <= 2) and "Alpha" == "Bravo"

# Instructions
# This time we'll give the expected result, and you'll use some combination of boolean operators to achieve that result.
#
# Remember, the boolean operators are and, or, and not. Use each one at least once!

# Use boolean expressions as appropriate on the lines below!

# Make me false!
bool_one = (2 <= 2) and "Alpha" == "Bravo"  # We did this one for you!

# Make me true!
bool_two =  1 < 2 and "Ray" == "Ray"

# Make me false!
bool_three = 1 > 2 or 2 < 1

# Make me true!
bool_four = 1 < 2 or (not 1 > 2)

# Make me true!
bool_five = 1 < 2 and ((not 1 > 2) or 1 > 2)
