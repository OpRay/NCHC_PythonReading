# And
# The boolean operator and returns True when the expressions on both sides of and are true. For instance:
#
# 1 < 2 and 2 < 3 is True;
# 1 < 2 and 2 > 3 is False.

# Instructions
# Let's practice with and. Assign each variable to the appropriate boolean value.
#
# Set bool_one equal to the result of False and False
# Set bool_two equal to the result of -(-(-(-2))) == -2 and 4 >= 16**0.5
# Set bool_three equal to the result of 19 % 4 != 300 / 10 / 10 and False
# Set bool_four equal to the result of -(1**2) < 2**0 and 10 % 10 <= 20 - 10 * 2
# Set bool_five equal to the result of True and True

bool_one = 1 < 0 and 2 > 3

bool_two = False and True

bool_three = False and False

bool_four = True and True

bool_five = 1 > 0 and 2 < 3
